# london-bike-sharing-analysis
This is a data visualization project on the bike sharing system in London (2015-2017) done using Power BI.\
The main objective of this project was to create attractive visuals tha communicated how weather affcted bike usage, display various simple moving averages, and show how bike usage varied for different periods.
  
The guiding questions I used are:

  * How does weather affect bike usage?
  * What is the total bike rides between specific periods?
  * What is the 2-week moving average?(7-day/30-day moving average)
  * How can I make my visuals more dynamic and more user friendly?

This project is still in progress, as I learn how to create dynamic and user friendly dashboards.\
Below are screenshots of what I have achieved so far (I currently don't have the pro license for Power BI to allow me to share the dashboard.)
